 * Created by Bobho_000 on 10/4/2015.
 * This is the bread, butter, everything of the game.
 * This is where everything from the internal rules that let you normal summon once (usually) per turn,
 * to that overpowered Exodia effect go. If anything is capable of anything, it's this.
 * <p/>
 * Also used to retrieve information about player's field, so that they can be modified by effects.
